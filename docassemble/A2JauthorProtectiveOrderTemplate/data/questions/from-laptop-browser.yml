     Your relationship with the person you need protection from and the harm they caused tells the court the kind of protective order you need. The court can order:
     
     * a domestic violence protective order, 
     * a stalking protective order, or 
     * a sexual assault protective order.
     
     Protective orders are also called restraining orders.

question: |
	Witnessing domestic violence is traumatic and harms children
subquestion: |
  % if who_needs_the_order == 'me and children':
  Some children experience more than the trauma of being a witness. 

  If the person who abused you **also** committed a "crime of domestic violence" against your ${children.as_noun()}, you can ask the court for a separate protective order for each child the person abused.
  % else:
   Did the abusive person commit a "crime of domestic violence" against your ${children.as_noun()}?
  % endif
  ## Things to think about: Pros and Cons

  If you ask the court for a protective order for each child the person abused, you will have to show the court that the abusive person committed a crime of violence. You do not have to name the crime, but your description must show the judge that the abusive person's behavior fits one of these crimes.

  If you did not witness the behavior yourself, (and you do not have another witness?) your child will have to testify.

  If it is not safe for the abused person to have visitation with your child or only supervised visitation is safe or you need to ask for primary custody your  case will be stronger if the judge gives your child their own protective order.

  # Comment: (Suzanne email Tue 8/2/2022 6:37 PM subj: DV petitions for minors)
under: |
  ####<i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Who can file - from Suzanne
  The truth is - there is a split among judicial officers in Anchorage and throughout the state.  Many people, myself included, interpret "other representative" broadly for the 20 day order.  (There are a few, however, who take the approach that the adult filing OBO must have some legal standing to do so - if not a parent or guardian then at least with a POA or delegation of parental rights or something). 
  Often at the time of the short-term hearing, the adult is advised to file a guardianship or go through OCS. At the long-term hearing, many think that if a Guardianship has not been filed or OCS is not taking at least legal custody, then the case can't proceed.  In many jurisdictions outside of Anchorage, the court will appoint a GAL who will then be substituted at the long-term hearing.  (We don't do that in Anchorage for the most part due to the limited resource.)
  I personally take a more liberal approach  particularly if it's a teenager and both parents are at least aware of the case/allegations.  I will authorize the adult as the "other representative" to go forward with the long-term.

  To get a protective order, the person who abused you must have committed a "crime of domestic violence" against you.
  
  You do not need to name the crime, but you must tell the judge as many details about the abuse as you can so the judge can see that the person who abused you committed domestic violence.

question: |
 A domestic violence protective order may be appropriate.
subquestion: |
  We have added information about how to ask the court for a domestic violence protective order to your Action Plan.
  
  Judges can order domestic violence protective orders that last for different periods:
  
  1. A short-term domestic violence protective order starts right away and lasts 20 days.<br>
   This is an "ex parte protective order".<br>
   The abusive person **only** gets notice about the order if the judge actually makes the order. The police give the abusive person a copy of the order and explain it.
  2. A long-term domestic violence protective order lasts 1 year.<br>
  You can ask the judge for a long-term protective order at the same time you ask for a short-term order.
  Somebody police?  notifies the abusive person that you have asked the court for a protective order.<br>
  The court schedules a hearing to be held about 20 days after you ask for a long-term order. Both you and the abusive person can testify.<br>
  If a short-term or long-term domestic violence protective order is granted, the court will forbid the abusive person to abuse you or your children. 
  3. A police officer can ask the court for an Emergency Domestic Violence Protective Order for you. This Emergency order lasts for 72  hours. The police do not ask for an Emergency order very often.

  You may not qualify for a Domestic Violence Protective Order
subquestion: |
  Based on your answers, a domestic violence protective order may not be appropriate if there was no domestic violence crime.  You may be experiencing domestic violence that may not be considered a crime under the law such as calling you names, making you feel like you shouldn't talk to friends or family, or limiting your access to money.  If you don't qualify for a protective order you can take steps to stay safe.  Information about options and safety planning has been added to your Action Plan.
